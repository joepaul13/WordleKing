# WordleKing
A bot to solve the Wordle game in the most optimised way possible.
I'm a huge fan of the Wordle game, and am pretty good at it too, so I thought of creating a bot that's better than me.
I've used data from NYTimes, ie, a list of words that are the answers, and a list of all 5-letter words.
I've used the NLTK, NumPy and Pandas libraries.
